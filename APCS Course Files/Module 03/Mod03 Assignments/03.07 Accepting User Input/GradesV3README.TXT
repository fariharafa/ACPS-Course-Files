<+s>: I was able to display the user's test scores in a neat manner. I used 
      scanner methods such as in.next() and in.nextInt(). I understood how to 
      acquire information from the user and use the information to display 
      results. Showing the total points and the average score was easy because 
      I had already formulated calculations. 

<-s>: I had difficulties organizing the information. At first, I was displaying the 
      the information recieved right after asking for it and it looked very messy. 
      Therefore, I decided to show all the results at the end after asking for the 
      last test score.I also had problems with asking for the first name and last
      name in one user prompt but I figured it out after reviewing the notes.

In the future: If I have difficulties with scanner methods, I will refer to this 
assignment. I will look at videos about scanner methods and practice so I can 
understand them better.
