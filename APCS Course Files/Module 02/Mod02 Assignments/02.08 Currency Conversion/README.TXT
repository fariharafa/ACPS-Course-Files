PROJECT TITLE: 02.08 Currency Conversion / ConversionCurrencyV1.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use conversison techniques and operators to calculate 
                    the amount of money from a specific country into the 
                    equivalent currency of another country given the

<+s>: I was able to display the conversion in a neat manner on the BlueJ terminal
      using conversion technique. I finished the assignment quickly because I realized 
      that the calculation has a repitive process and all I had to 
      do was change the variables to find outcome of the spending. Additionally, I
      was able to display the Souvenir Purchases without subtracting or multiplying.

<-s>: It took time for me to understand the prompt especially the Souvenir Purchases 
      section. I created an expression to help me understand the directions and calculate 
      the spending using division, casting, and modulus. I used 100 = 12x+ 4 and solved for x.
      After that, I was able to program the souvenir purchases.

In the future: If I have difficulties with converting or mathematical word 
problems, I'll come back to this assignment. I want to explore how to control
the decimal numbers so it outuput can be displayed in a neat manner.
