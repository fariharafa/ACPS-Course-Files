**************************************PMR**************************************
<+s>: Using BlueJ was helpful as it points your syntaxes for you. 
      I was able to display the expressions in a neat manner on the BlueJ terminal
      using integer and double variables. 

<-s>: There were times I would forget the format to concatenate string literals 
      and variables but I got the hang of it once I was typing more. I would 
      forget to add the (+) symbol when to cocatenate.  
      
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I'll keep practicing and refer to this assignment if I am 
confused on displaying numbers and expressions using double and integer variables.
I will also explore different ways to display a statment and its format.
