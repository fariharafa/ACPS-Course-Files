<+s>: Using BlueJ was helpful as it points your syntaxes for you. 
      I was able to display the information in a neat manner on the BlueJ terminal

<-s>: There were times I would confuse print() and println() but I got the hang
      of it once I was typing more. I would sometimes forget to end the print
      statement with a quotation mark, a parenthesis, or a semicolon. It was 
      difficult to organize the information in a neat manner at the beginning but 
      then I used Notepad to draft my assignment
      
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I'll keep practicing and refer to this assignment if I am 
confused betweene print() and println(). I will also explore different ways 
to display a statment and its format.
